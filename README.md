# Tezwal ✨

Tezwal is a crypto wallet for tezos xtz using tezos as the block chain technology in the backend. 🎈

## Getting Started
Tezwal is a flutter based Tezos Wallet that uses Hive and tezter_dart and helps in storing and sending/receiving funds with ease.It is secure as it is built totally on Tezos platform.

It is a easy way to check your transaction history/current values and also send/recieve transactions between different addresses by simply generating a QR code which could be then scanned and the the transaction is complete.

🔥We have used Hive as aur backend to create blocks of data and and its fast and secure,used tezter_dart dart for tezos implementation.We have also implemented a chatbot with dialogflow using google cloud platform for help in case someone needs more information or help about any topic.🔥
